# Leaf-Disease-Detection-System-using-MATLAB
This project detects plant diseases from leaf images, enabling early intervention and promoting healthier crops. This project also recommends suitable pesticides upon detection.
The agricultural sector plays a pivotal role in global food security and economic stability, yet it grapples with numerous challenges ranging from water scarcity to pest infestations and climate variability. Traditional farming practices often rely on manual irrigation methods and subjective pest management techniques, resulting in inefficient resource utilization and diminished crop yields. Moreover, the increasing unpredictability of weather patterns exacerbates these challenges, leaving farmers vulnerable to crop failures and economic losses. 
Characteristics :

These characteristics highlight the project's commitment to leveraging advanced technologies for efficient resource management, enhanced crop productivity, and sustainability in agricultural practices.
